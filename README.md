# Code de Reed Solomon

A small project consisting of an algorithm for the Reed-Solomon code
Two essentials features : 
- Getting the lagrange polynomial interpolation based on the value, and the message to send with the redundance symbols
- Retrieving the original message based on the message and the numbers of symbol serving a data purpose

+ Having a final result with message based on bits (for my grand oral)




Credit to a document from the university of Berkley which gave me the method :) (not the algorythm tho, and not the pivot de gauss method for solving linear equations)
